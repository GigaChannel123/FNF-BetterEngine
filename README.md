# Friday Night Funkin' - Better Engine
THIS IS NOT OFFICIAL ENGINE!!

This Just A Modification Psych Engine That I'll Add a Leather Engine And Kade Engine Features

Example :

Leather Engine : Extra Keys, Mods Menu Image, Icon, Winning Icon, And More :P

Kade Engine : Circle Note (from kade engine 1.8), Custom Story Menu, Custom Main Menu, And More :P

## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

To install LuaJIT do this: `haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/AndreiRudenko/linc_luajit ` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml
